		Olumo Rock is an irregular formation of igneous rock with a massive outcrop of granite rock composition. Olumo Rock is located at Ikija in Abeokuta, around Itoku Market where the signature product of Ogun State, Adire is manufactured and sold. The Rock served as a testament of refuge and safety to the ancient dwellers of the Egba Kingdom. History reveals that in the 19th century, the Rock provided a vintage for the people who took solace at the cave-like openings beneath the Rock called ‘Abeokuta’ in the Yoruba language. Intra tribal wars broke out amongst the then Dahome people and the Egba people and in search for refuge, Olumo Rock was discovered.
